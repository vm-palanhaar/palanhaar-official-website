      <p>
        Palanhaar Solutions Private Limited was founded with a vision inspired by the name <strong>“Palanhaar”</strong> — another name for Lord Krishna, the eternal guide and protector.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like Krishna, our mission is to serve people with clarity, purpose, and empowerment. We aim to build products that help individuals grow and enable local businesses to become sustainable and profitable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rooted in Indian values and driven by modern innovation, we strive to make travel and tourism more inclusive, culturally rich, and accessible for all — by connecting real people to real experiences.
